Code to replicate results from:

Cychosz, M., Edwards, J. R., Munson, B., Romeo, R. R., Kosie, J., & Newman, R. S. (*under review*). The everyday speech environments of preschoolers with and without cochlear implants. [10.31234/osf.io/kvzt4](https://psyarxiv.com/kvzt4)

# datasets

* `dataframes/CI_TH_matches.csv` - contains props of looks to target for all children

* `dataframes/icphs_speech.csv` - contains scores for standardized assessments 

* `dataframes/icphs_voc_voc.csv` - contains audiological information for children with cochlear implants

* `dataframes/icphs_ctc.csv` - contains hearing ages for all participants

* `dataframes/icphs_voc_its.csv` - generated by `1_audiological_information.R`

# scripts to process .its files
## Note that these scripts were adapted from scripts also located in the [HomeBank Git Repo](https://github.com/HomeBankCode)

* `get_CHN_clips.py` - extract data about child vocalizations from LENA .its files (counts, intensity, timestamps, etc.)

* `get_its_info.py` - extract basic metadata such as child age and gender from LENA .its file preamble

* `get_speech_clips.py` - extract data about ambient speech from LENA .its files (FAN, FAF, MAN, OLN, etc.)

* `get_CTC_clips.py` - same as above, but to get counts of conversational turns

# modeling and scripts to replicate results

* `everyday_CI.Rmd` - main results markdown; also contains explanatory code to process .its files (but note that .its files are not shared publicly so that code chunk is for presentation purposes only)

# manuscript and figures

* `everyday_CI_notAnon.pdf` - main manuscript including appendix with audiological information

* `supp_materials_notAnon.pdf` - supplementary materials to explore timing of vocal contingency 

* `figures/` - directory containing figures found in manuscript
